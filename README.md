# URL Shortener Client

A simple URL shortener made in Sveltekit with help of [Lambda functions](https://github.com/moreSalt/url-shortener)

This is currently deployed on Vercel, and uses their analytics and speed insights. If you wish to disable those, go to `src/routes/+layout.svelte` and delete the packages.
